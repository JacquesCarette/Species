This operator, 'dissection', turns a container-like functor into a bifunctor representing a one-hole context in which elements to the left of the hole are distinguished in type from elements to its right.},

templates where data is stored. We show that containers have good closure properties under a variety of constructions including
the formation of initial algebras and final coalgebras. We also show that containers include strictly positive types and shapely
types but that there are containers which do not correspond to either of these. Further, we derive a representation result
classifying the nature of polymorphic functions between containers. We finish this paper with an application to the theory
of shapely types and refer to a forthcoming paper which applies this theory to differentiable types.

	title = {Species: making analytic functors practical for functional programming},
	abstract = {Inspired by Joyals theory of species, we show how to add new type constructors and constructor combinators
to the tool set of functional languages. We show that all the important properties of inductive types lift
to this new setting. Species are analytic functors, representing a broader range of structures than regular
functors. This includes structures such as bags, cycles and graphs. The theory is greatly inspired by
combinatorics rather than type theory: this adds interesting new tools to bear, but also requires more
work on our part to show that species form a good foundations for a theory of type constructors. The
combinatorial tools provide a calculus for these structures which has strong links with classical analysis,
via a functorial interpretation of generating series. Furthermore, we show how generic programming idioms
also generalise to this richer setting. Once the theory is understood, various methods of implementation are
relatively straightforward.},

We then present a generic decision procedure for Epigram’s in-built equality at each type, taking a complementary approach to that of Benke, Dybjer and Jansson [7]. We also give a generic definition of map, taking our inspiration from Jansson and Jeuring [21]. Finally, we equip the regular universe with the partial derivative which can be interpreted functionally as Huet’s notion of ‘zipper’, as suggested by McBride in [27] and implemented (without the fixpoint case) in Generic Haskell by Hinze, Jeuring and Löh [18]. We aim to show through these examples that generic programming can be ordinary programming in a dependently typed language.},

  function equations, counting sequences, and random generation algorithms can
  be compiled from specifications. Asymptotic properties can be determined
  automatically for a reasonably large subclass. Maple libraries that implement
  such decision procedures are briefly surveyed (LUO, combstruct, equivalent).
  In addition, libraries for manipulating holonomic sequences and functions are
  presented (gfun, Mgfun).},

  Some type class instances can be automatically derived from the
  structure of types. As a result, the Haskell language includes the
  "deriving" mechanism to automatic generates such instances for a
  small number of built-in type classes. In this paper, we present
  RepLib, a GHC library that enables a similar mechanism for arbitrary
  type classes. Users of RepLib can define the relationship between
  the structure of a datatype and the associated instance declaration
  by a normal Haskell functions that pattern-matches a representation
  types. Furthermore, operations defined in this manner are
  extensible---instances for specific types not defined by type
  structure may also be incorporated. Finally, this library also
  supports the definition of operations defined by parameterized
  types.

  abstract =     {   
  Polytypic programming is a way of defining type-indexed
  operations, such as map, fold and zip, based on type information.
  Run-time polytypic programming allows that type information to
  be dynamically computed---this support is essential in modern
  programming languages that support separate compilation, first-class
  type abstraction, or polymorphic recursion.
  
  However, in previous work we defined run-time polytypic programming
  with a type-passing semantics. Although it is natural to define
  polytypic programs as operating over first-class types, such a
  semantics suffers from a number of drawbacks. This paper describes
  how to recast that work in a type-erasure semantics, where terms
  represent type information in a safe manner.  The resulting language
  is simple and easy to implement---we present a prototype
  implementation of the necessary machinery as a small Haskell
  library.
