\maketitle

What is a \term{memory}?  There are many possible ways to answer this
question, depending on how concrete you wish to be and what features
you wish to model.  We will start by taking the abstract position that
\emph{a memory is a store of values}, that is, a place where values
can be stored and later retrieved.

What sort of structure does a memory need to have to make this
possible?  In order to be able to retrieve values after storing them,
there must be some way to refer to them by their location, so we
suppose that each location has a \emph{label}.  For now, we suppose
only that the labels form a \term{setoid}, that is, a set together
with an equivalence relation, so that one can at least talk about
whether two labels are equal.

\ExecuteMetaData[latex/models.tex]{labels}

Some kind of picture?  Talk about coat hooks or cubby holes?
