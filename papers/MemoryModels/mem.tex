\maketitle

What is a \term{memory}?

\todo{Picture here of something! Cubby holes, keys, \dots}

We will start by taking the abstract position that \emph{a memory is a
  store of values}, that is, a place where values can be \emph{stored} and
later \emph{retrieved}.

What sort of structure does a memory need to have to make this
possible?  In order to be able to retrieve values after storing them,
there must be some way to refer to values by their location, so we
suppose that each location has a \emph{label}.  Then a \term{memory}
is just a mapping from labels to values.

\ExecuteMetaData[latex/models.tex]{memory}

For now, we don't assume that labels have any additional structure.
It may be helpful to imagine a memory as a ``soup'' of locations.
