What to write about, precisely?

* Taking labels seriously
* Taking constructiveness seriously.

  - "Finite" sets: isomorphism to Fin n.  But the precise isomorphism
    matters.  Use it to index into underlying storage.

    - Talk about implementation of unit, singleton, sums, products,
      composition.

  - Partial isomorphisms / subset relation.  (Note it corresponds to
    prisms from lens --- so we can compose them nicely. =)

    - Subset vs E*E.  U.
    - Sharing storage by subsetting.

    - Decomposition operations.

  - Case study: array operations.

    - Stuff about forgetting labels/canonical relabeling etc.
