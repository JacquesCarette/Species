To build the paper, you will need

  * lhs2TeX

    I assume you already have this, or know how to install it.

  * shake

    'cabal install shake' should get this if you don't have it.

  * diagrams

    You need the standard diagrams packages along with the postscript
    backend, diagrams-builder package, and SVGFonts package:

      cabal install diagrams diagrams-postscript -fps diagrams-builder SVGFonts

    This ought to work on all platforms under both GHC 7.4 and 7.6.
    Let me know if you have trouble.
