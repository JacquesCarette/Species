-- Why have I included both fold and fold-lemma rather than simply a

-- functions I wanted to define. However, the functions were defined
-- together with (partial) correctness proofs, and were unnecessarily
-- hard to read. I wanted to be able to define functions which were
-- easy to read, like the _++_ function below, and then have the
-- option to prove properties about them, like Any-++.
--
-- Unfortunately this turned out to be harder than expected. When
-- proving the Any-++ lemma it seemed as if I had to prove that _++_
-- preserves bag equivalence in its first argument in order to
-- instantiate the "respects bag equivalence" argument. However, my
-- preferred proof of this property uses Any-++…
--
-- An alternative could be to assume that equality of functions is
-- extensional, in which case the "respects bag equivalence" argument
-- could be removed. Another option would be to listen to Conor
-- McBride and avoid higher-order representations of first-order data.
